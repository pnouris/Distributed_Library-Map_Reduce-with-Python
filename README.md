# Map-reduce-Using-Python
Distributed and Cloud Computing 

##Part 1
Design  and  implement a distributed data storage system using a remote
object paradigm which allows employees to perform the following six tasks:
1. Display all six pieces of information relating to the set of books currently stored.
2. Add a book to the set of books currently stored; a newly added book should have a status of not on loan. 
   The Book unique ID should be returned after completion of this task.
3. Display the subset of books currently stored which have a publication date within a specified inclusive year range (e.g. 2000-2010).
4. Display the subset of books currently stored which have a specified ISBN.
5. Set the status of all books with a specified ISBN to on loan.
6. Set the status of all books with a specified ISBN to not on loan.

##Part 2
Given a CSV file where each line contains a set of numbers,  write a MapReduce 
program which determines the maximum of all numbers in the file.

##Part 3
Given a CSV file where each line contains a set of numbers, write a MapReduce program which determines the mean of all numbers in the file
